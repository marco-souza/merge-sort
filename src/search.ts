 *  How is it works?
 * -----------------
 *
 * binarySerach function receives a lists, a number and if you want the position or not
 * It returns the position if the number exists on that list, or -1 if it doesn't
 * - if list have more than one element
 * - if B empty, returns A
 * - if A[0] less than B[0], returns a new list with A[0] as the first item
 *      and the merge result between remaining A and B
 * - if B[0] less than A[0], returns a new list with B[0] as the first item
 *      and the merge result between A and remaining B
