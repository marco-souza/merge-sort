# Functional Merge Sort

Functional implementation of quick sort in TypeScript.

## Why Merge Sort?

Merge Sort is **as faster as** Quick Sort `O( n * log(n) )` but in the worst case, Merge sort is **more stable**!

Quick sort have complexity of `O( n^2 )` in the worst case, while Merge Sort maintains `O( n * log (n) )`.
